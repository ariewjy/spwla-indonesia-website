Direct measurement relies on actual measurement, dimension, volume, pressure, etc. It can be done using several methods, from the simple one: caliper, to the complex one: Boyle’s law."

    "text": "Indirect Measurement\nIndirect measurement relies on physical properties of the rock that has implication to porosity. such as Hydrogen Index, Bulk Density and Slownees. This measurement usually related to logging data either Wireline or LWD (well-log measurement). The benefit of this measurement compare to direct measurement is its continuous measurement of data. Since core porosity is discontinuous and a luxury that not every company/petrophysicist has. What usually happen is the logging data is being used as main data to calculate porosity of the rock. While direct measurement of core porosity being used as calibration point for porosity from log (see Track Porosity at Figure 5 below). The most common indirect measurements are density, neutron, and sonic/acoustic.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Example of Well-Log Measurement"
