    "text": "Introduction\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A hunter aiming animals\n\n\nLet’s imagine a condition where we are hunting a bear or any animal at the forest, we have been waiting and preparing so long just to wait the right moment to fire our gun or our crossbow (Figure 1). However, we forgot to calculate the wind effect so that we missed our target and we went back home bringing nothing but sad feelings.\nThe same thing can also happen to petrophysicist, after performing “fancy” petrophysical analysis which took a long time to be finished and lots of papers to be read, in the end the result was not as good as we hoped for or maybe we did not get any result at all (no flow)\n\nafter performing ‘fancy’ petrophysical analysis which taking so long time to be finished and hundreds of papers to be read, in the end the result is not as good as we hoped for or maybe we do not get any result at all (no flow).\n\nIn this edition, we will give you a brief overview about the uncertainty and how it relates to petrophysics.\n\n\nRandom (Statistical) Vs Systematic Errors\nAll of us know what is error? However, do we know that there are two types of error? They are random (or statistical) and systematic errors. These two terms also apply in Petrophysics realm.\nin Petrophysics, random error (uncertainty) is usually defined as error caused by measurement or how the data was acquired. This type of error is usually called as noise or statistical error and can be reduced by increasing the number of measurement or data gathered. Whereas systematic error is defined as error caused by shifting, intentional “wrong-doing”, poor calibration, wrong model used, and every action that leads to different result from what it should be. This type of error cannot be reduced by averaging process or data gathering.\n\nthe systematic uncertainty can appear due to wrong environmental correction, varying well-bore condition, tool limitation, etc. Whereas in core data, it can appear due to measurement errors, volume of data (too little data for calibration), etc.\n\nIn addition, the other type of uncertainty is geological uncertainty. However, it is hard to define this particular uncertainty as it is very difficult to be distinguished from random and systematical uncertainties.\n\nthe combination of both random and systematic errors is what then define the total error or uncertainty in Petrophysics Realm.\n\nIn log data, the systematic uncertainty can appear due to wrong environmental correction, varying well-bore condition, tool limitation, etc. Whereas in core data, it can appear due to measurement errors, volume of data (too little data for calibration), etc.\nIn opposite to systematic error which mostly has big impact on the result, statistical error may or may not have big impact on the result. For instance, as we have larger volume of input data to be averaged over a reservoir zone, the less uncertainty that we will have in our log input (Fylling 2002). However, in multiple wells with limited data availability, incorrect zonal average of petrophysical properties can cause significant difference with the value it should be.\nPutting aside the geological uncertainty for simplicity, therefore the combination of both random and systematic errors is what then define the total error or uncertainty in Petrophysics Realm.\n\n\nAccuracy Vs Precision\nIn data analysis, we often hear about accuracy and precision (Figure 2). What is the difference between these two terms? As Petrophysicist, it is good to know the difference of these terms so that we can understand and explain it whenever somebody asks us about what we did.\nAccuracy is used to describe the difference between the measured and true value of a parameter. This accuracy is usually affected by systematic error. Precision is used to describe the distribution of a data around the average measured value. This is usually affected by random error.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The difference between accuracy and precision\n\n\n\n\nSensitivity Analysis\nSensitivity analysis is a process that allows us to evaluate the effect of uncertainties in our input parameters to certain result. In Petrophysics case, the method can be read further in a paper published by (Owens 1990). The example of this analysis can be seen in estimation of uncertainty based on Archie equation calculation of Sw for a North Sea Rotliegendes Gas Field, which the results are expressed in terms of % of Gas Initial in Place (GIIP), see below.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: GIIP Sensitivity Analysis\n\n\nFrom Figure 3 we can see that porosity (Ф) and m have larger effects to the change of GIIP compared to other parameters, thus the uncertainty. Hence, what the petrophysicist should do is focusing their effort of reducing uncertainty on these two parameters.\n\n\nMonte-Carlo Analysis\nIn recent years, the development of computer has provided an opportunity for Monte-Carlo Analysis to be performed in petrophysical analysis. Compared to the analytical method which time consuming to be performed, Monte-Carlo is assumed to be more straightforward.\nThe basic of Monte-Carlo is that it uses random numbers and probability descriptors for input variable to investigate problems expressed as mathematical formulae. The example of how this Monte-Carlo was performed in a real case, in a same unit reservoir with different fluid bearing scenario can be seen in paper published (Adams 2005). \n\n\nKnowing Your Uncertainty\nMost people will probably think that: \"Why should I concern about this? It just slows down my working progress\".\nDo not underestimate the importance of adding uncertainty consideration in your final report, because knowing uncertainty is essential part of being petrophysicist as it will help us to:\n\nUnderstand the size of uncertainty of our data and result.\nUnderstand the sources of uncertainty and putting the order of importance to be addressed.\nDesign the best method or practice of data gathering to eliminate and addressing the greatest source of uncertainty.\nGive estimation of uncertainty of volumetric calculations.\nPredict the volumetric probability (P10, P50, P90)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAdams, S.

    "text": "Introduction\nIn 1927, the first log (Figure 1) was recorded by Schlumberger brothers, 500m deep well in France. Since then, logging tools have been emerged as a way for us to record the physics of rock beneath earth’s surface. 1927; the first electric log (SP and resistivity log), 1932; the first caliper log and dipmeter (along with sidewall coring), and 1939 the first nuclear log (gamma ray). During that time, SP and resistivity were the most used logs to interpret where the oil is. However, the interpretation is merely qualitative, without any quantitative information (porosity, oil saturation). Until 1942, when Gus Archie published paper: “The Electrical Resistivity Log as an Aid in Determining Some Reservoir Characteristics”. He laid the basic foundations of quantitative interpretation between porosity-resistivity and saturation of hydrocarbon in reservoir, which introduced us to the whole new world of modern log interpretation.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: First Log\n\n\n\n\nWho is He?\nGustave E. Archie (Figure 2) was graduated from Wisconsin University in two degrees, Mining and Electrical Engineering. Archie started his professional career in Shell Oil Company, spending more than 30 years (1933-1967) as production engineer, logging engineer, to exploitation manager until his retirement. His most influenced contribution to well log interpretation is pioneering modern well log measurement to determine hydrocarbon reservoir. His contribution towards oil and gas industry earns him a Lester C. Uren Award in 1964 and AIME’s Anthony F. Lucas Gold Medal for recognition of his pioneering achievements in 1978. He has four papers under his name, which help to pave the way from qualitative interpretation towards quantitative interpretation and better understanding about petrophysics as we know today.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Gus Archie (1970-1978)\n\n\n\n\nThe Origin of Archie’s Equation\nThere are some people who thought that Archie’s equation is like the one that we know today (Equation 1). The truth is at the early publication from Gus Archie in 1942, Archie actually never wrote that famous equation explicitly. It took several times to get to there. Instead, he wrote six formulas (Figure 3), a step by step of his thought process towards the final equation to calculate water saturation.\nIn the final equation, Archie never states the “a” as tortuosity factor and “m” as cementation factor. They are nothing but gradient/ exponents in the relationship from crossplot. In his paper, Archie stated that “m” usually ranges from 1.8-2.0, and “n” usually 2. He never stated anything about “a”, “m”, nor “n” as meaningful constants. Although later on after Archie, several authors have been trying to relate those constants to something related to rock (cementation, wettability, permeability, etc).\n\\[\nS_{w} =  \\sqrt[n]{\\frac{a \\times R_{w}}{\\phi^m \\times R_{t}}}\n\\tag{1}\\]\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Original Archie’s Equations\n\n\nOut of 4 papers that have been published by Gus Archie, there are 2 fundamental papers that shaped our understanding in petrophysics. First is the 1942’s paper, which talked about quantitative interpretation of well log measurement based on rock properties (porosity and saturation). Second is the 1950’s paper, which talked about rock-type, talking about connection and interaction between porosity-permeability-pore size distribution-water saturation-and capillary pressure (Figure 4).\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Rocktype Archie\n\n\nIn this paper, it was the first time Archie proposed the term “Petrophysics” as the study of physics of the rock (hence the name; petro-physics). Take a look at what Gus Archie proposed in his paper in 1942:\n\nThere is a need for a term to express the physic of rock. It should be related to petrology as much as geophysics is related to geology. “Petrophysics” is the suggested as the term pertaining to the physics of particular rock types, whereas geophysics pertains to the physics of larger rock system composing the earth, (Archie, 1942).\n\n\n\nThe Development of Archie’s Equation\nAfter the original paper from Archie in 1942, and continued with several important papers afterwards (1947, 1950, and 1951). The busy years of Gus Archie has passed and successfully changed our understanding towards hydrocarbon evaluation using well log measurement. By far, Archie’s Equation is the most used equation in petrophysical industry. The equation is so robust and reliable in almost any condition of the reservoir. It is simple and it just works.\nHowever, since 1942 people has been considering that the Archie’s equation needs to be improved. It is in 1944, just 2 years after Archie’s first paper. Hubert Guyod, a Houston-based well logging consultant proposed the term “m” as cementation exponent. Next in 1950, Wyllie and Rose proposed the tortuosity factor (“a”) in Archie’s equation (Figure 5). These two insights of Archie’s original equation are crucial, as they reveal the fact that these constants (a & m) are not a single unique number, rather they are related to properties of the rock itself.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Turtuosity Factor\n\n\nLater those years, in 1952, Winsaeur and colleagues from Humble Oil & Refining Company thought that the tortuosity factor is a good idea and did some experiments on sandstone core samples all over US. They found out what we know now as Humble Formula, a different type of Archie, with “a=0.62” and “m=2.15” different from the original Archie’s equation (Figure 6). Eventually, after years, in 1960s, Wyllie and Gregory settled and proposed a new form of Archie’s equation, as we know today (Equation 1). Where “a”, “m”, and “n” are a constants/ archie’s constants.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Different value for a and m exponent\n\n\nYears after that, several authors have been trying to find a way to calculate “m” from porosity. Although some publications were available, these approach of calculating “m” using porosity and other variable, needs to be taken by caution due to its unique and specific case only (Figure 7)\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Calculating m from Porosity\n\n\nResearch about “a”, “m”, and “n” of Archie’s equation have been done years after that. Even further, it has been applied to carbonate rocks instead of using just sandstones. One of the most famous publication was done by Jerry F. Lucia from Shell Oil Company, which shows that “m” is vary from different type of porosity, such as fracture porosity and vuggy porosity (Figure 8).\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Relationship between rocktype and m value\n\n\n\n\nThe non-Archie Reservoir\nAlthough Archie’s equation has been used extensively in oil and gas industry, the reliability of it has been challenged over the past 50 years. Historically speaking, his equation is an empirical equation. Meaning, it was based on actual data that he was working on, with certainly some conditions and treatments which need to be met prior to experiment.\nThese conditions (two most important) are matrix is insulator and the only conductivity pathway is saline water in pores. These conditions were met when Archie proposed his equations. However, after Archie, people started to meet challenging reservoir like shaly sand, fresh water, or conductive mineral. These types of reservoir are not the same reservoir as Archie tested. Archie’s tested rock was clean sandstone with good intergranular porosity. These types of reservoir usually called a “Archie Reservoir”, while other challenging reservoir where Archie’s assumptions were not met is called “Non-Archie Reservoir”. Worthington lists all the conditions between Archie and Non-Archie Reservoir (Figure 9).\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Archie Reservoir Criteria (Worthington, 2011)\n\n\n\n\nClosing Words\nDespite the weaknesses of Archie’s equation, the significance of Archie’s contribution in paving the way for modern log interpretation is unfathomable. His equation is so simple, not simplest. It was based on empirical experiments, and it just works. Although there are over 300 equations have been developed to encounter all Non-Archie reservoir, especially shaly sand. We can clearly say that Gustave E. Archie is the founding father of modern Petrophysics."

Since core porosity is discontinuous and a luxury that not every company/petrophysicist has. What usually happen is the logging data is being used as main data to calculate porosity of the rock. While direct measurement of core porosity being used as calibration point for porosity from log (see Track Porosity at Figure 5 below). The most common indirect measurements are density, neutron, and sonic/acoustic.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Example of Well-Log Measurement"
